# Address_Matching

Please refer to my blog post: https://dt1086.medium.com/address-matching-through-cosine-similarity-f68f3b48c110.

It is my understanding that there are no legal concerns here, as insurance companies within the Exchange must provide provider directory data with their insurance plans. If this is not the case, please reach out to me at dt1086@stern.nyu.edu
